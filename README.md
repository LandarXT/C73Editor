# C73Editor
A pretty terrible notepad app I made for some reason

## How to compile

You need Visual Studio Community (Landar uses 2019, 2022 should also work)

The only thing you need to select is .NET Desktop development.

Once you've opened up VSC select "Clone a repository"

And then type in "https://github.com/LandarXT/C73Editor"

The solution should now open as a Visual Studio project.
